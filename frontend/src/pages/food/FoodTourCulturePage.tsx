Discover the subtle differences between steamed momos that preserve the juicy tenderness of the filling, fried momos that offer a satisfyingly crispy exterior, and kothey-style momos that combine the best of both worlds with a pan-fried base and steamed top. Learn how the filling—whether savory minced meat, earthy mushrooms, or creamy paneer—is seasoned with a secret blend of spices that varies from family to family, creating a unique signature taste. The experience culminates in a lesson on chutney making, where you will learn to balance the fiery heat of dalle khursani (Himalayan fire chili) with the tangy sweetness of tomato and the aromatic complexity of cilantro and timur, creating a condiment that elevates the humble momo to a culinary masterpiece.',

          'Step into a traditional Tibetan noodle house and witness the mesmerizing art of thenthuk preparation, where skilled artisans transform a simple dough of flour and water into rustic, hand-pulled noodles with a satisfyingly chewy texture. The magic lies in the technique: the dough is kneaded, stretched, and flattened before being expertly pulled and torn directly into a simmering broth, ensuring that each noodle absorbs the rich flavors of the soup. The broth itself is a masterpiece of simplicity, a clear and fragrant concoction of bone broth, seasonal vegetables, and tender meat, seasoned with ginger, garlic, and a hint of star anise. This one-bowl meal, born from the nomadic traditions of the Tibetan plateau, is a testament to the beauty of simplicity, where the quality of ingredients and the skill of the maker shine through in every comforting bite.',
